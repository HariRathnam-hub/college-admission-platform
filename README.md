# Smart Online College Admission Management System

A complete, production-ready admission platform with three roles — **Student**,
**Faculty**, and **Admin** — covering the full application lifecycle from
program discovery through admission confirmation.

## Structure

```
college-admission-platform/
├── backend/     Node.js + Express + TypeScript API
└── frontend/    React 19 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn UI
```

## Quick start

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # MONGODB_URI + JWT secrets are required; Cloudinary/Resend are optional
npm run seed:programs   # optional: seeds 20 sample engineering programs
npm run dev              # http://localhost:5000
```

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev              # http://localhost:5173
```

Document uploads fall back to local disk (served at `/uploads`) without
Cloudinary credentials, and notification emails are logged instead of sent
without a Resend key.

## Roles

All three roles log in through the same `/login` page — the API returns the
account's role and the app routes to the matching dashboard automatically.
Public self-registration only ever creates **Student** accounts; Faculty and
Admin accounts are provisioned by an Admin from **Admin → Faculty** / a
direct role change in **Admin → Users**.

- **Student** — complete profile, browse programs, apply (draft → submit),
  upload/replace/delete documents (passport photo, Aadhaar, 10th/12th
  marksheets, transfer/community/income certificates, signature), track
  status on a visual timeline, withdraw an application, and see faculty
  messages and correction requests.
- **Faculty** — a personal "Assigned Reviews" queue (plus an "Unassigned"
  tab to self-claim applications), applicant profile + document review,
  document verification (verify/reject with remarks), a formal
  recommend-approve/recommend-reject **Review**, internal reviewer notes,
  direct messages to the student, and correction requests.
- **Admin** — dashboard analytics (students/faculty/applications/programs/
  approved/rejected/pending/documents), full program CRUD, user management
  (activate/deactivate/reassign roles), faculty account provisioning,
  application assignment to faculty and final admission decisions, a
  cross-application document view, and notification broadcast (to
  everyone, a role, or one named student).

### Application status flow

`DRAFT → SUBMITTED → UNDER_REVIEW → DOCUMENTS_PENDING (optional) →
FACULTY_APPROVED / FACULTY_REJECTED → ADMIN_APPROVED / ADMIN_REJECTED →
ADMISSION_CONFIRMED`, with `WITHDRAWN` reachable by the student from any
pre-decision state. Every transition is appended to `statusHistory` (actor +
note) and notifies the student in-app and by email.

Faculty can only set faculty-tier statuses (`UNDER_REVIEW`,
`DOCUMENTS_PENDING`, `FACULTY_APPROVED`, `FACULTY_REJECTED`) on
applications assigned to them; Admin can set any status on any application.

## API overview

| Area | Base path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Auth | `/api/v1/auth` | Register (student-only), login, refresh, logout, me |
| Student profile | `/api/v1/students` | Self profile; `/students/:userId/profile` for staff |
| Programs | `/api/v1/programs` | Public browse; Admin create/update/deactivate |
| Applications | `/api/v1/applications` | Draft/submit/withdraw/list/get/delete |
| Documents | `/api/v1/documents` | Upload/replace/list/delete |
| Notifications | `/api/v1/notifications` | List, mark read, mark all read |
| Faculty | `/api/v1/faculty` | Queue, claim, status, review, notes, message, document verification, profile |
| Admin | `/api/v1/admin` | Users, faculty accounts, analytics, program listing, application assignment/decisions, documents, broadcast |
| Health | `/api/v1/health` | Liveness/readiness probe |

Full request/response shapes are in the Zod validators under
`backend/src/validations/`.

## Data model

Reused and extended existing collections rather than duplicating them:

- **User** — role is now `STUDENT | FACULTY | ADMIN`.
- **StudentProfile** — unchanged.
- **FacultyProfile** *(new)* — employee ID, department, designation, phone.
- **Program** — unchanged.
- **Application** — extended with `assignedFaculty` and the new status enum;
  `statusHistory` (embedded) continues to serve as the audit timeline.
- **Review** *(new)* — a faculty member's formal recommendation
  (`RECOMMEND_APPROVE` / `RECOMMEND_REJECT` + comments), separate from the
  existing freeform internal notes.
- **DocumentFile** — extended with `verifiedBy`, `verificationDate`,
  `remarks`, and an expanded `type` enum matching the required upload list.
- **Notification** — unchanged; broadcast now also supports a single named
  student as the target.
- **AuditLog** — unchanged; records every admin/faculty mutating action.

## Security & production hardening

JWT access + rotating refresh tokens, `helmet`, `mongo-sanitize`, `hpp`,
`compression`, tiered rate limiting, centralized error handling, structured
Winston logging, and audit logging — all carried over from the existing
foundation and extended to cover the new endpoints.

## Deployment

`backend/render.yaml` and `frontend/vercel.json` are included and unchanged
by this update.

## Verified

- `backend`: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes with zero errors; `ts-node` dev-mode
  startup (the actual `npm run dev` path) confirmed free of type errors.
- `frontend`: `npx tsc -b` and `npx vite build` both complete successfully.
